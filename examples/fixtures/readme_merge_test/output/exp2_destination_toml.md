| RubyGems (the [GitHub org][rubygems-org], not the website) [suffered][draper-security] a [hostile takeover][ellen-takeover] in September 2025.                                                                |
| Ultimately [4 maintainers][simi-removed] were [hard removed][martin-removed] and a reason has been given for only 1 of those, while 2 others resigned in protest.                                             |

## 🌻 Synopsis

`toml-merge` provides intelligent merging of TOML files by parsing them into
tree-sitter AST nodes and comparing structural elements. It supports:

- **Smart key matching** - Keys and tables are matched by their structural signatures
- **Table matching** - Tables are matched using a multi-factor scoring algorithm that considers
  key similarity, value overlap, and position
- **Freeze blocks** - Mark sections with comments to preserve them during merges
- **Configurable merge strategies** - Choose whether template or destination wins for conflicts,
  or use a Hash for per-node-type preferences with `node_splitter` (see [ast-merge](https://github.com/kettle-rb/ast-merge) docs)
- **Full TOML support** - Works with all TOML 1.0 features including inline tables, arrays of tables, and dotted keys


### The `*-merge` Gem Family

The `*-merge` gem family provides intelligent, AST-based merging for various file formats. At the foundation is [tree_haver][tree_haver], which provides a unified cross-Ruby parsing API that works seamlessly across MRI, JRuby, and TruffleRuby.

**Example implementations** for the gem templating use case:

| Gem | Purpose | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| [kettle-dev][kettle-dev] | Gem Development | Gem templating tool using `*-merge` gems |
| [kettle-jem][kettle-jem] | Gem Templating | Gem template library with smart merge support |

### Configuration

The tree-sitter TOML parser requires a shared library. Set the `TREE_SITTER_TOML_PATH` environment variable to point to your compiled `libtree-sitter-toml.so` (or `.dylib` on macOS):

```bash
export TREE_SITTER_TOML_PATH=/path/to/libtree-sitter-toml.so
```

### Basic Usage

```ruby
require "toml/merge"

template = <<~TOML
  [package]
  name = "my-app"
  version = "1.0.0"
  
  [dependencies]
  serde = "1.0"
TOML

destination = <<~TOML
  [package]
  name = "my-app"
  version = "2.0.0"
  authors = ["Custom Author"]
  
  [dev-dependencies]
  tokio = "1.0"
TOML

merger = Toml::Merge::SmartMerger.new(template, destination)
result = merger.merge

puts result.content if result.success?
# The [package] section is merged with destination's version and authors preserved,
# [dependencies] from template is included,
# [dev-dependencies] from destination is kept
```

## ✨ Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```console
bundle add toml-merge
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```console
gem install toml-merge
```

### 🔒 Secure Installation

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>For Medium or High Security Installations</summary>

This gem is cryptographically signed, and has verifiable [SHA-256 and SHA-512][💎SHA_checksums] checksums by
[stone_checksums][💎stone_checksums]. Be sure the gem you install hasn’t been tampered with
by following the instructions below.

Add my public key (if you haven’t already, expires 2045-04-29) as a trusted certificate:

```console
gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/galtzo-floss/certs/main/pboling.pem)
```

You only need to do that once.  Then proceed to install with:

```console
gem install toml-merge -P HighSecurity
```

The `HighSecurity` trust profile will verify signed gems, and not allow the installation of unsigned dependencies.

If you want to up your security game full-time:

```console
bundle config set --global trust-policy MediumSecurity
```

`MediumSecurity` instead of `HighSecurity` is necessary if not all the gems you use are signed.

NOTE: Be prepared to track down certs for signed gems and add them the same way you added mine.

</details>

## ⚙️ Configuration

```ruby
merger = Toml::Merge::SmartMerger.new(
  template_content,
  dest_content,
  # Which version to prefer when nodes match
  # :destination (default) - keep destination values
  # :template - use template values
  preference: :destination,

  # Whether to add template-only nodes to the result
  # false (default) - only include keys that exist in destination
  # true - include all template keys and tables
  add_template_only_nodes: false,

  # Token for freeze block markers
  # Default: "toml-merge"
  # Looks for: # toml-merge:freeze / # toml-merge:unfreeze
  freeze_token: "toml-merge",

  # Custom signature generator (optional)
  # Receives a node, returns a signature array or nil
  signature_generator: ->(node) { [:table, node.name] if node.type == :table },
)
```

## 🔧 Basic Usage

### Simple Merge

```ruby
require "toml/merge"

# Template defines the structure
template = <<~TOML
  [package]
  name = "my-app"
  version = "1.0.0"
  
  [dependencies]
  serde = "1.0"
  tokio = "1.0"
TOML

# Destination has customizations
destination = <<~TOML
  [package]
  name = "my-app"
  version = "2.0.0"
  authors = ["Custom Author"]
  
  [dev-dependencies]
  criterion = "0.5"
TOML

merger = Toml::Merge::SmartMerger.new(template, destination)
result = merger.merge
puts result.content
```

### Using Freeze Blocks

Freeze blocks protect sections from being overwritten during merge:

```toml
[package]
name = "my-app"

# toml-merge:freeze Custom configuration
[secrets]
api_key = "my_production_api_key"
db_password = "super_secret_password"
# toml-merge:unfreeze

[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"
```

Content between `# toml-merge:freeze` and `# toml-merge:unfreeze` markers is preserved from the destination file, regardless of what the template contains.

### Adding Template-Only Tables

```ruby
merger = Toml::Merge::SmartMerger.new(
  template,
  destination,
  add_template_only_nodes: true,
)
result = merger.merge
# Result includes tables/keys from template that don't exist in destination
```

## 🦷 FLOSS Funding

While kettle-rb tools are free software and will always be, the project would benefit immensely from some funding.
Raising a monthly budget of... "dollars" would make the project more sustainable.

We welcome both individual and corporate sponsors! We also offer a
wide array of funding channels to account for your preferences
(although currently [Open Collective][🖇osc] is our preferred funding platform).

**If you're working in a company that's making significant use of kettle-rb tools we'd
appreciate it if you suggest to your company to become a kettle-rb sponsor.**

You can support the development of kettle-rb tools via
[GitHub Sponsors][🖇sponsor],
[Liberapay][⛳liberapay],
[PayPal][🖇paypal],
[Open Collective][🖇osc]
and [Tidelift][🏙️entsup-tidelift].

### Another way to support open-source

I’m driven by a passion to foster a thriving open-source community – a space where people can tackle complex problems, no matter how small.  Revitalizing libraries that have fallen into disrepair, and building new libraries focused on solving real-world challenges, are my passions.  I was recently affected by layoffs, and the tech jobs market is unwelcoming. I’m reaching out here because your support would significantly aid my efforts to provide for my family, and my farm (11 🐔 chickens, 2 🐶 dogs, 3 🐰 rabbits, 8 🐈‍ cats).

If you work at a company that uses my work, please encourage them to support me as a corporate sponsor. My work on gems you use might show up in `bundle fund`.

I’m developing a new library, [floss_funding][🖇floss-funding-gem], designed to empower open-source developers like myself to get paid for the work we do, in a sustainable way. Please give it a look.

**[Floss-Funding.dev][🖇floss-funding.dev]: 👉️ No network calls. 👉️ No tracking. 👉️ No oversight. 👉️ Minimal crypto hashing. 💡 Easily disabled nags**

## 📌 Versioning

This Library adheres to [![Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][📌semver-img]][📌semver].
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs.
Specifically, if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward compatibility,
a new version should be immediately released that restores compatibility.
Breaking changes to the public API will only be introduced with new major versions.

> dropping support for a platform is both obviously and objectively a breaking change <br/>
>—Jordan Harband ([@ljharb](https://github.com/ljharb), maintainer of SemVer) [in SemVer issue 716][📌semver-breaking]

I understand that policy doesn't work universally ("exceptions to every rule!"),
but it is the policy here.
As such, in many cases it is good to specify a dependency on this library using
the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][📌pvc] with two digits of precision.

For example:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency("toml-merge", "~> 3.0")
```

<details markdown="1">
<summary>📌 Is "Platform Support" part of the public API? More details inside.</summary>

SemVer should, IMO, but doesn't explicitly, say that dropping support for specific Platforms
is a *breaking change* to an API, and for that reason the bike shedding is endless.

To get a better understanding of how SemVer is intended to work over a project's lifetime,
read this article from the creator of SemVer:

## 🤑 A request for help

Maintainers have teeth and need to pay their dentists.
After getting laid off in an RIF in March, and encountering difficulty finding a new one,
I began spending most of my time building open source tools.
I'm hoping to be able to pay for my kids' health insurance this month,
so if you value the work I am doing, I need your support.
Please consider sponsoring me or the project.
