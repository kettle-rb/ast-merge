    # Base class for mapping unified git diffs to AST node paths.

    # DiffMapperBase provides a format-agnostic foundation for parsing unified
    # git diffs and mapping changed lines to AST node paths. Subclasses implement
    # format-specific logic to determine which AST nodes are affected by each change.
