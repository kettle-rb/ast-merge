    # Base class for computing match scores between two nodes.
    #
    # Match scores help determine which nodes from a template should be linked
    # to which nodes in a destination document. This is particularly useful for
    # complex nodes like tables where simple signature matching is insufficient.
    #
    # The scoring algorithm is provided as a callable object (lambda, Proc, or
    # any object responding to :call) which receives the two nodes and returns
    # a score between 0.0 (no match) and 1.0 (perfect match).
    #
    # Includes Comparable for sorting and comparison operations.
    #
    # @example Basic usage with a lambda
    #   algorithm = ->(node_a, node_b) { node_a.type == node_b.type ? 1.0 : 0.0 }
    #   scorer = MatchScoreBase.new(template_node, dest_node, algorithm: algorithm)
    #   puts scorer.score # => 1.0 if types match
    #
    # @example With a custom algorithm class
    #   class TableMatcher
    #     def call(table_a, table_b)
    #       # Complex matching logic
    #       compute_similarity(table_a, table_b)
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   scorer = MatchScoreBase.new(table1, table2, algorithm: TableMatcher.new)
    #
    # @example Comparing and sorting scorers
    #   scorers = [scorer1, scorer2, scorer3]
    #   best = scorers.max
    #   sorted = scorers.sort
